Q1. What are the major features in different versions of Spring Framework?

Ans :
Features of Spring are
-It provides pluggability
-It supports Dependency Injection in two forms : Constructor injection & Setter Injection
-It supports AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
-It provides containers thus easy to manage garbage
-It is Light weight and lossly coupled

Q2. What is a Spring Framework?

Spring is an object lifecycle management framework using which we can mange the creation and usage and destruction of objects. Here we handle objects as beans. A bean is class enclosed in a container. We represent each class as bean using bean tag in a configuration file which is in XML form. Then spring will instantiate objects from beans when needed. 

In spring there are two types of containers(IoC Containers) are available. They are bean factory and ApplicationContext. Bean Factory is the base on which ApplicationContext is built. Nowadays in industry we use ApplicationContext to create web applications. BeanFactory can be used when we are creating a stand alone application or console application. 

We can initialise a bean using dependency injection. It is of two types - constructor injection and setter injection
The default scope of a bean is singleton, where we share the same bean for many use. Or we can set the scope as prototype where different instances of beans generates as needed.
Two types of wiring are there in the spring framework: They are explicit wiring and Auto-wiring. In explicit wiring we specify the reference to a bean explicitly using ‘ref’ tag where in case of auto-wiring, spring itself will find the reference using name or type(whatever we provided in the ‘Auto-wiring’ tag).

Q3. List the advantages of Spring Framework

The advantages of Spring are,
-Using spring we can easily manage the creation and destruction of objects(object life cycle management)
-It is free to use : We can directly download it from the internet without paying
-It is light weight and loosely coupled.
-It is easy to test using dependency injection
-It has high flexibility

Q4. What are the different features of Spring Framework?

Features of Spring are
-It provides pluggability
-It supports Dependency Injection in two forms : Constructor injection & Setter Injection
-It supports AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
-It provides containers thus easy to manage garbage
-It is Light weight and lossly coupled

Q5. How many modules are there in Spring Framework and what are they?

Q6. What is a Spring configuration file?

It is an XML file where we configure the beans.

Q7. What are the different components of a Spring application?

-beans
-contexts
-containers

Q8. What are the various ways of using Spring Framework?

We can use spring using BeanFactory and ApplicationContext. Nowdays ApplicationContext is prefered over BeansFactory and BeanFactory is used only for console applications.

Q9. What is Spring IOC Container?

Spring IOC containers are containers they carry beans.
The two IOC containers are
-BeanFactory
-ApplicationContext
ApplicationContext is built over the BeanFactory and it is used to create web applications.

Q10. What do you mean by Dependency Injection?

Dependency injection provides the ways to initialize an object using beans. Here we provide the values in the configuration file and then initialize an object in the test class using these beans.


Q11. How to install spring boot in IntelliJ IDEA?
step1: download spring boot jre
step2: go to file->project_structure->libraries->'+sign' and then Select the libraries

Q12. Please change default server port from 8080 to 9090? 

We can change the port number in settings.gradle

Q13. How to resolve whitelabel error page in spring boot application?


Q14. How are i18n and localization supported in Spring MVC?


Q15. Differentiate between a Bean Factory and an Application Context.

Both the BeanFacory and ApplicationContext are two IOC containers available in Spring.

BeanFactory is the basic container which is used to create console application and Application context is used to create web applications.

ApplicationContext is built over BeansFactory
