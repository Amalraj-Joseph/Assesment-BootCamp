Q1. What are the major features in different versions of Spring Framework?

Ans :
Features of Spring are
-It provides pluggability
-It supports Dependency Injection in two forms : Constructor injection & Setter Injection
-It supports AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
-It provides containers thus easy to manage garbage
-It is Light weight and lossly coupled

Q2. What is a Spring Framework?

Spring is an object lifecycle management framework using which we can mange the creation and usage and destruction of objects. Here we handle objects as beans. A bean is class enclosed in a container. We represent each class as bean using bean tag in a configuration file which is in XML form. Then spring will instantiate objects from beans when needed. 

In spring there are two types of containers(IoC Containers) are available. They are bean factory and ApplicationContext. Bean Factory is the base on which ApplicationContext is built. Nowadays in industry we use ApplicationContext to create web applications. BeanFactory can be used when we are creating a stand alone application or console application. 

We can initialise a bean using dependency injection. It is of two types - constructor injection and setter injection
The default scope of a bean is singleton, where we share the same bean for many use. Or we can set the scope as prototype where different instances of beans generates as needed.
Two types of wiring are there in the spring framework: They are explicit wiring and Auto-wiring. In explicit wiring we specify the reference to a bean explicitly using ‘ref’ tag where in case of auto-wiring, spring itself will find the reference using name or type(whatever we provided in the ‘Auto-wiring’ tag).

Q3. List the advantages of Spring Framework

The advantages of Spring are,
-Using spring we can easily manage the creation and destruction of objects(object life cycle management)
-It is free to use : We can directly download it from the internet without paying
-It is light weight and loosely coupled.
-It is easy to test using dependency injection
-It has high flexibility

	A. Hibernate
	B. Toplink
	C. Ibatis
	D. All of the above

13. What is byName mode of autowiring?	
	A - Default setting which means no autowiring and you should use explicit bean reference for wiring.
